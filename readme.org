* Wordcount analysis of the draft Alberta K-6 Curriculum

  This project is an incomplete and possibly buggy bunch of scripts and data aiming to determine some of the changes
  between the current Alberta K-6 curriculum and the draft curriculum introduced at the end of March, 2021.

  Running the script produces some ~csv~ files that can be analyzed.

** Known issues
   - Grade 7-9 content is present in some of the current curriculum
   - Unicode is not handled well, leading to issues in words with accents
     - The processing is applied equally to both versions, so matching still works reasonably
   - No way to determine context of usage of various words
     - Manually looking for discrepant words can provide some value, however
   - Filtered list is filtered arbitrarily
     - I made up the rules for filtering, I think it works /reasonably/ well, but there could be issues

** Analysis
   This is my analysis and I am not an expert in curricula at all.

*** Some changes that stand out to me
**** An increase in religious language

     Notes:
     - "Washington" is used in several contexts. As the State, the City, in names of Treaties, and euphemistically for the American Government
     - 12 of 18 usages of "independence" in the draft curriculum are references to American independence
     - 0 of 9 usages of "independence" in the current curriculum are references to American independence

     The draft curriculum does not include the term aboriginal and prefers indigenous, a word not present in the
     current curriculum.

     Actually, indigenous is the most used word in the draft that was not in the previous curriculum by a large margin.
